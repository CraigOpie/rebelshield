# RebelShield

RebelShield is a cutting-edge, privacy-preserving API for blockchain-based authentication and access control using gRPC. The project aims to provide a secure and efficient solution for managing API access in various applications while ensuring privacy and compliance with international data protection standards.

## Components

- `blockchain`: The blockchain system implementation for user registration, authentication, and access control. Includes smart contracts, DIDs, and verifiable credentials.
- `grpc-api`: The gRPC API implementation for secure communication between clients and the server, including server and client code based on protobuf schema.
- `privacy-preserving`: Integration of privacy-preserving techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, or homomorphic encryption.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RebelShield project, please follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the README files of each component.

# gRPC API Component for RebelShield

This component of the RebelShield project provides the gRPC API implementation for secure communication between clients and the server. It includes server and client code generated from the protobuf schema and handles user authentication, request signing, and API responses.

## Prerequisites

- gRPC and Protocol Buffers
- A running instance of the blockchain component (see the `blockchain` folder for setup instructions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `grpc-api` directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
3. Generate the server and client code from the protobuf schema using the provided gRPC tools.

## Usage

1. Set up and run the gRPC server to expose the API and handle incoming requests securely.
2. Implement and run the gRPC client to interact with the server, handling user authentication, signing requests, and processing API responses.

## Testing

Thoroughly test the gRPC API component for security, privacy, and performance. Identify and address any potential weaknesses or bottlenecks.
